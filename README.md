# Weight-Tracker-Android
# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirement was designing a weight tracking application where users can set a goal to lose weight and be notified via SMS notification when that goal is reached. Users can input their daily weight into a database. Users needed to be able to edit and delete entries and see a history of the weights they entered.
