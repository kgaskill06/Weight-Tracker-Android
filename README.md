# Weight-Tracker-Android
# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirement was designing a weight tracking application where users can set a goal to lose weight and be notified via SMS notification when that goal is reached. Users can input their daily weight into a database. Users needed to be able to edit and delete entries and see a history of the weights they entered. 

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
A login screen and create user feature was necessary to help users access the core functionality of the application by creating a database for their own username. A screen to accept android permissions to send SMS was needed to help users receive the text message from the application when the goal is met. A landing page that showed a user their goal and allow them to add weights to the data table. My designs were successful because they gave a user friendly user interface experience with easy access to features required by the user goals. 

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I like to break down each function with pseduocode around each feature of the application and plan how each different feature connects to another. This helps me plan for how some class reference objects are created around certain tasks. This strategy is also helpful when dealing with multiple features that rely on accessing different classes since combining it all can be rather tricky when you leave something out. This isn't to say you cannot build off it later, it just makes it easier.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I adopt the philopshy of test early and test often. This is helpful tracking errors as they come up instead of putting in a lot of code just to try and go through all the additions to find the thing that is wrong. This was  helpful in making sure certain features were working the way they were intended. Some issues did come up with Android Studio not launching when prevented me from further debugging. 

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I want to say I got innovative when it came to the user interface and how close to home I could get it from familiar applications from android in look and apperance. I also tried to get really creative with how I created my database from DAO's. 

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Hard to say exactly when my application failed to be completed in time. I will continue to work on it but I think overall my handling of the DAO's shows critical thinking with how they were created alongside class reference variables.
